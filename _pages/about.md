I am a ML engineer at SmartNews, Inc. 
In my free time, I do research on machine learning for graphs and kernel methods.
I am extremely fortunate to work with Dr. [Takanori Maehara](http://www.prefield.com/) at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project since 2019 on graph learning theory.

My professional goal is to combat misinformation while upholding the freedom of speech.

My personal goal is to understand the limitation and prospect of graph-structured data learning by developing analysis tools from [graphon theory](https://web.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/) and spectral graph theory.
All information and opinions on this website are my own.

I enjoy long distance [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/74469543) in Japan.
