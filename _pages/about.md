I am a PhD candidate at the School of Computing, Tokyo Institute of Technology.
My research interests include machine learning for graphs and kernel methods.
I am extremely fortunate to work with Dr. [Takanori Maehara](http://www.prefield.com/) at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project since 2019 on graph embedding theory.
Currently, I am a viting researcher at the Functional Analytic Unit of RIKEN AIP, hosted by Dr. [Ha Quang Minh](http://www.haquangminh.info/).

My research goal is to understand the limitation and prospect of graph-structured data learning by developing analysis tools from [graphon theory](https://web.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/) and spectral graph theory.

I enjoy long distance [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/74469543) in Japan.
