<p>As an electronics engineering major, I initially thought of “embedding” as a kind of small
sub-systems used as a small computer. Later, graph theory gives me
another view of “embedding”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Graph embedding of a graph <script type="math/tex">G</script> on a surface <script type="math/tex">\Sigma</script> is a representation
of <script type="math/tex">G</script> on <script type="math/tex">\Sigma</script> in which points of <script type="math/tex">\Sigma</script> are associated to vertices
and simple arcs are associated to edges such that connectivity is preserved and
there is no over-lapping between edges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This view of “embedding” is more abstract, and somewhat more fun. I understand it
as the act of “drawing” a graph onto another surface (or space). It is well known
that any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph">planar graph</a> can be embedded
on a 2D surface, and any graph can be embedded on a 3D “surface”. However, recently,
the word “embedding” seems to mean something more concrete to a machine learning practitioner:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Embedding, as in “word embedding”, refers to a set of modeling and feature learning
techniques that map structured tokens to vectors of real numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think embedding <strong>is</strong> dimensionality reduction or representation learning,
just another different fancy name. Maybe, in the context of natural language processing
and graph processing, we call dimensionality reduction embedding <img class="emoji" title=":ok_hand:" alt=":ok_hand:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44c.png" height="20" width="20">.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>There were many <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5538">representation learning</a>
algorithms in the field of machine learning. One of the most famous method is
<a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-spectral.pdf">Spectral Clustering</a>
in which the <em>similarity</em> of data is preserved while the dimensionality is reduced.
More recently, the <a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/">t-SNE</a> algorithm is widely used
for data visualization. The general objective of t-SNE is somewhat similar to
Spectral Clustering. However, instead of dealing with large matrix computation,
the authors solved the embedding problem by minimizing a loss function defined
for the representations of each data point in two spaces (original data space and
the embedding space). The result of t-SNE is a 2D or 3D representation of
high dimensional data.</p>

<p>Similar to the t-SNE technique, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6652">DeepWalk</a> was
proposed by Perozzi et al at KDD’14. DeepWalk and other algorithms inspired by
it were based on the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf">Skipgram</a> model proposed by Mikolov et al in 2013.
By observing the similarity between the vertex frequencies distribution on random walks
in a graph and the word frequency distribution in text, Perozzi et al proposed
that we can use random walks on a graph to generate “sentences”, and then learn
the node representation using the Skipgram model. The slide
for my talk introducing DeepWalk at The University of Tokyo can be found <a href="https://gearons.org//assets/docs/DeepWalk_2016_UTokyo.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, <em>Deepwalk</em> is an algorithm that uses the word2vec
software package on a generated artificial text. The “text” here is 
generated by performing random walks on graphs. Such idea is simple
and effective.</p>

<p><img src="https://gearons.org//img/deepwalk_dist.png" alt="Power law">
<em>The power law is observed in both domains. This observation can be the motivation for Deepwalk.</em></p>

<p>Denote a random walk starting from vertex <script type="math/tex">i</script> is <script type="math/tex">W(v_i)</script>. The set containing
all random walks is denoted <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{C} = \cup_{i \in V} W(v_i)</script> with <script type="math/tex">V</script> is the vertex set.
Under this notations, the optimization problem is formulated in the same way as the skipgram model:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{min}_{\Phi} = - \log P({v_{i-w}...v_{i+w}} | \Phi(v_i))</script>

<p>In the optimization problem above, <script type="math/tex">\Phi(v_i)</script> is the mapping from a vertex to its vector
representation. The probability is assumed to be able to factor as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P({v_{i-w}...v_{i+w}} | \Phi(v_i)) = \Pi_{j \in \text{window}(i)} P(v_j | \Phi(v_i))</script>

<p><img src="https://gearons.org//img/deepwalk_example.png" alt="Deepwalk">
<em>Demonstration of how Deepwalk works.</em></p>

<p>From here there are two problems need to be solved:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How to construct the formula for <script type="math/tex">P(v_j \mid \Phi(v_i))</script>.</li>
  <li>How to efficiently learn and compute the conditional probability.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the first problem, two embedding matrices are introduced. The first matrix
is <script type="math/tex">\Phi_C</script> - the context matrix storing the embedding of the centered vertices (<script type="math/tex">v_i</script>). 
The second matrix is <script type="math/tex">\Phi_E</script> - the embedding matrix storing surround vertices’ embedding vectors.
These two matrices are jointly-learned as the algorithm scans the corpus.</p>

<p>There are two popular solutions for the second problem: hierarchical softmax and negative sampling 
(my personal favorite learning algorithm). <a href="https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/hierarchical-nnlm-aistats05.pdf">Hierarchical softmax</a>
is a decomposition technique that computes the conditional probability using a binary tree. In this technique,
we first organize the words (in our context they are graph vertices) into the leaves of a binary tree. Then, the
conditional probability <script type="math/tex">P(v_j \mid v_i)</script> is given by the probability of a random walk starts at the root node
and ends at the leave node representing <script type="math/tex">v_j</script>. The probability of turning left or right is computed with vector
for <script type="math/tex">v_j</script> and vectors associated with the intermediate binary tree nodes. We can compute the probability as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(w|w_i) = \Pi^{L(w)-1}_{j-1} \sigma([n(w,j+1) = ch(n(w,j))] \cdot v^\top_{n(w,j)}v_{w_i})</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">[\cdot]</script> is a condition evaluation operator that returns 1 if true and -1 otherwise and <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script> is
the sigmoid function. The detail of this function is explained in
<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/syllabus.html">Stanford’s CS224n course</a>. I highly recommend reading
the material provided there. Their lecture notes are extremely well-written (thank you Stanford! <img class="emoji" title=":thumbsup:" alt=":thumbsup:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png" height="20" width="20">).</p>

<p><img src="https://gearons.org//img/hs.png" alt="Hierarchical Softmax"></p>

<p>This picture is an attempt to visualize how hierarchical softmax works. At the first step of the algorithm,
tokens (words or vertices) are assigned to the leaves of a binary tree. This assignment can utilize Huffman
coding for minimum path length (frequent tokens get shorter paths from root). The root node and leave nodes
of the binary tree are just placeholder. The algorithm keeps two sets of learn-able vectors: 1. The embedding
vectors associated with each token (not on the tree), and 2. The vectors associated with the internal nodes
of the binary tree (blue nodes in the figure above). When we need to compute a conditional probability, say
<script type="math/tex">P(a \mid b)</script>, the embedding vector of <script type="math/tex">b</script> and the internal node vectors will be used. For each internal
node, we take the inner-product of <script type="math/tex">v_b</script> and its associated vector then apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">sigmoid function</a> to the scalar result. The output of the sigmoid functions are interpreted
as the probability of going <strong>left</strong> from that node. Finally, the conditional probability <script type="math/tex">P(a \mid b)</script> equals
the probability of going from root node to leaf node <script type="math/tex">a</script>. Note that due to the property of binary trees, the
probability is naturally normalized (P(going left) + P(going right) = 1).</p>

<p>Intuitively, I think of negative sampling as “pushing away” bad samples and “pulling in” good samples in the
embedding vector spaces. When the algorithm “sees” a pair of vertices that are supposed to be close to each
other, it updates the vectors to maximize the inner product. On the other hand, when the algorithm is given 
a pair of negative samples which is generated from some distribution, it tries to minimize the inner product.
Under the hood, this algorithm optimize a objective that discriminate “true” samples (samples from our dataset)
against “negative” samples (samples generated from some distribution). Negative sampling rises from a technique
named <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/gutmann10a/gutmann10a.pdf">Noise Contrastive Estimation</a>. NCE deals with
the intractable normalization term in unnormalized parametric statistical models. Instead of computing the 
normalization term directly, NCE views the normalization term as a learn-able variable. Then, the problem of 
learning the model parameters and the normalization term is posed as a linear regression to discriminate true
data samples and generated (negative) data samples. Such technique shows great time-performance trade-off.</p>

<h2 id="our-method">Our method</h2>

<p>Having introduced the background of representation learning for nodes in graphs based on word2vec, I will introduce
our insight and attempt to improve Deepwalk. First, some analogues:</p>

<p>It is a common knowledge that “friends of friends are friends”. In network science, this phenomenon can be captured
by the statistic of a subgraph in the shape of a triangle.</p>

<p><img src="https://gearons.org//img/all_3.png" alt="Size 3 motifs"></p>

<p>While simple friendships are represented by triangles, I am curious about other types of subgraphs and their 
functionalities in a network. More specifically, I am interested in how communities are formed. My hypothesis
is that the simple recurring subgraphs (from now I call them <em>motifs</em>) are the building blocks for communities.
Then, I investigated the <a href="http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=z-score">z-scores</a> for 
each directed size-3 motifs on a <a href="http://networkrepository.com/polblogs.php">benchmark network dataset</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://gearons.org//img/polblogs.jpg" alt="Polblogs z-scores"></p>

<p>For each motifs in the vertical axis, I first compute its z-score for the whole network. Then, I exacted three 
sub-networks: Intra communities (2 networks for each label) and inter-communities (contains only inter-community
links). The z-scores for each networks is reported in the figure above. We are particularly interested in motifs
that has high z-scores for intra-communities, but low z-scores for inter-communities. These motifs are likely to
be the patterns that <em>build</em> communities.</p>

<p>From this insight, we propose <em>motifwalk</em>. Our method aims to improve the result of DeepWalk through context manipulation.
More conretely, instead of only perform random walk, we propose the concept of
biased walk for context generation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Definition: <strong>biased walk</strong> - A random walk in which the next vertices is chosen based on a pre-defined probability distribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keeping the same learning process as DeepWalk, we propose to generate the artificial context that favor a certain 
motifs. In such way, nodes within a community are more likely to be closer in the embedding space. The motifs pattern
for the biased random walk are selected based on some knowledge about the network or the z-score. Motif selection is
so far the weakest point of my proposed model as I have not come up with a concrete method of motif selection.</p>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>I conducted experiment on several benchmark networks. The f1-macro score for <a href="http://socialcomputing.asu.edu/datasets/BlogCatalog3">Blogcatalog3</a> and Cora is presented here:</p>

<p><img src="https://gearons.org//img/bc_motifwalk.png" alt="blogcatalog and cora" height="80%" class="small-center"></p>

<p>The random walk on blogcatalog is the triangle motif, while on cora it is the bi-fan motif (size-4). The embedding
is learned by a word2vec model implemented using tensorflow.</p>
