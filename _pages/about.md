In my free time, I do research on machine learning for graphs and kernel methods.
I am extremely fortunate to work with Dr. [Takanori Maehara](http://www.prefield.com/) at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project since 2019 on graph learning theory.

Download my [resume](/assets/pdf/HoangNT_CV.pdf).

My personal goal is to understand the limitation and prospect of graph-structured data learning by developing analysis tools from [graphon theory](https://web.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/) and spectral graph theory.
All information and opinions on this website are my own.

I enjoy long distance [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/74469543) in Japan.
