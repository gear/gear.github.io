_Note: Due to some unavailibity in resources, I have stopped working
on this project. However, I will continue in the future when I have better
knowledge, tools, and connection to tackle the problem here. Also, some
content will still be udpated. 2016/06/16._

I think the mystery of networks is the mystery of human brains. I have three
point of views about the human brain: biological neuronal network, brain functional
network, and artifical neural network modeling. In order to understand how
a brain works, we need to understand not only the individual operation of a single
biological neuron, but also their operation as a complex network. One of the limitation
we have today in brain research is the level of detail we can get from our
own brain. For example, even the most advanced technique such as BOLD fMRI can only produce 
macro-level data (compared to neuronal level). On the other hand, abeit the scale,
data received from brain imaging techniques is extremely noisy. Recent advancements in
deep neural network have shown promising result in learning underlying structure in
noisy data. However, deep neural network requires special machines and the model 
is very task-specific (not flexible). Another more traditional approach is to apply
statistical learning techniques on brain data. In this project, I am particularly
interested in applying probabilistic inferencing to infer functional connection from
the EEG data. **The main target of the project is to provide researcher and medical
doctor with a programmable tool that given a brain parcellation and EEG settings,
it can accurately infers the functional connection between regions of the brain.**
