I enjoy research on machine learning for graphs (shout out to my mentor, Dr. [Takanori Maehara](http://www.prefield.com/)).

My personal goal is to understand the limitation and prospect of graph-structured data learning by developing analysis tools from [graphon theory](https://web.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/) and spectral graph theory.
All information and opinions on this website are my own.

I enjoy long distance [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/74469543) in Japan.
