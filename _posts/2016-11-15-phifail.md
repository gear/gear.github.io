## Problem definition

Detecting failure in a distributed system setting is a desirable task for many
obvious reasons. This paper introduces an implementation of an adaptive (accrual) 
failure detector. In this $$\varphi$$ accrual failure detector, the conditions of 
the network is accumulated and used to update the probabilistic model for failure 
suspicion. Compares to the existing models in 2004, which output of suspicion level 
is binary, this implementation has the advantage of returning a real-value suspicion level.
The authors compared their implementation to [Chen Fault Detection](http://chenfd)
and [Bertier Fault Detection](http://bertier). For the benchmark scheme, they 
set up two computers between Japan and Switzerland transferring "heart beat" signal
from Japan. They then later analyzed the collected data over a week and reported
the result.

- **Input**: A set of master processes $$\mathcal{M}$$ and a set of worker 
processes $$\mathcal{W}$$. The master processes are in charge of monitoring the 
worker processes.
- **Output**: An indicator of failure for each worker processes.
- **Assumption**: In this paper, for the shake of simplicity, the authors assumed
that the master processes will never crash. Furthermore, only one worker and one 
master scheme was discussed in this paper.

## Method

As mentioned above, this paper proposed an abstract accrual failure detector
and a simple implementation of the idea with only 2 processes. This figure 
illustrates the differences in the conventional failure detection architecture
and the proposed accrual failure detection architecture.

The main different in the proproposed architecture is the ability to return
many suspicion levels instead of just binary levels. This scheme enable the system
to perform many action as well as adaptive action based on the suspicion input
level. In the proposed architecture, the _suspicion level_ is represented by
a value called $$\varphi$$. The suspicion level is defined by a logarithmic scale:

$$ \varphi(t_{now}) \triangleq -\log_{10}(P_{later}(t_{now} - T_{last})) $$

This formula is intuitive in the sense that it penaltize the delay $$t_{now} - T_{last}$$
by a log scale of some pre-defined probabilistic model $$P_{later}(t)$$. In this 
paper, the authors defined a threshold $$\Phi$$ for $$\varphi$$. Since this $$\varphi$$
variable is computed in the log-scale, $$\Phi$$ also has logarithmic meaning. Each of
the unit step increase of $$\Phi$$ will lead to ten times confident interval of
failure detection. However, this fact only means that the confident about a failure 
dection is high, it doesn't take into account the _speed_ of the dectection.

The probabilistic model is given by the formula: 

$$ \begin{align} P_{later}(t) &= \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{t}^{+\infty} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} dx \\ &= 1 - F(t) \end{align}$$

Note that the formula above is just the implementation of the abstract accrual 
failure detector in this paper. Theoretically speaking, we can choose any computable
$$P_{later}{t}$$ that is suitable to our need. The picture below demonstrate this
probabilistic model.

Until this point, we have the suspicion level $$\varphi$$ and the probabilistic
model for computing $$\varphi$$. In order to adapt the network condition
into the failure detection scheme, the authors created a sized window with size
$$WS$$. When the heart beat signal is arrived, it time stamp is stored into
the window. The mean $$\mu$$ and variance $$\sigma^2$$ of the data in the
window is maintained as the window received new data. In addtion, there are
two variable keeping track of sum and sum of square of all element in 
the window are also maintained for computation convenient. The dataflow
of the proposed implementation:

![Flow]({{site.baseurl}}/img/phifail_flow.png)

The dataflow figure above captured all the essential steps of the proposed
algorithm. From the network, heartbest signal is collected and its time period
is stored in the sampling window. To my understanding, the sampling window
is a FIFO unit that removes oldest data when new data is added. The mean and
variance for the probabilistic model $$P_{later}(t)$$ is then computed using
the data in the sampling window. At every time step, the value of $$\varphi$$
is computed using the probabilistic model, the time of last arrival and the 
current time. This value $$\varphi$$ will then be used in different application
for various action. For example, in _action 1_, the threshold for $$\varphi$$ is
$$\Phi_1$$. Let's say in this moment, $$\varphi > \Phi_1$$, hence the machine will
perform _action 1_ (e.g. warning, reallocate resources, etc.). On the other hand,
_action 2_ has the threshold of $$\Phi_2$$, which is larger than $$\varphi$$ at
the moment, hence no action is performed. More interestingly, the multi-level 
suspicion $$\varphi$$ enables the use of parametric action, which means the machine
doesn't have to behave in a binary manner (performs action or not), but it can 
perform actions to a certain degree adapting to the current situation. 

## Experiment

As mentioned above, the setting for experiment is a heartbeat signal transmission
between Switzerland and Japan. Three failure detection schemes are compared: Chen FD,
Bertier FD, and (this) $$\phi$$ FD. The window size of 1,000 is used for all failure
detectors. In this paper, the authors conducted 4 experiments:

- Exp1: Average mistake rate $$\lambda_M$$. This experiment aims to provide some reasoning
between the average mistake rate and the threshold $$\Phi$$. 
- Exp2: Average detection time $$T_D$$. In this experiment, the relation between average
detection time and the threshold is studied. Consistent with what I mentioned above,
while the average mistake rate $$\lambda_M$$ decreased with high threshold (8-12), 
the detection time is increased significantly.
- Exp3: Effect of window size. The window size is plotted against the mistake rate.
There are three lines representing 3 values of $$\Phi$$: 1,3,5. The result showed that
larger widnow size leads to lower mistake rate. The result for different values of $$\Phi$$
is also consistent with experiment 2.
- Exp4: Comparision with Chen FD and Bertier FD. The authors conducted two experiment in
this category. First experiment is comparision in the internet setting and the second is
in the LAN setting. In both experiment, $$\phi$$ FD outperformed the other two methods.

More detail is provided in the authors' paper.

## Conclusion

This post only provides very high level abstraction of the authors' work. I left out
many discussion on the propertiesof failure detector, time period or heartbeat signal
and the effect of network delay. Nevertheless, the results provided in this paper
showed that the new scheme doesn't imply additional cost in term of performance while
it yields much better deteciton results under the authors' benchmark. On another note,
the authors also stated that based on their experimental result, it was sufficient to
use normal distribution for the probabilistic model.
